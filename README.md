# Introduction

This project contains the online help for all NAV-X apps and verticals. It is published under docs.nav-x.com. The main target for this help is Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

# Getting Started

If you are a NAV-X employee, please clone the repository and create a user branch. Once the user branch (and possibly also feature branch) is created, you can start modifying the help or adding to the help. If you are contributing otherwise, please ensure that you fork the repository and then push pull requests. Please ensure that you always reference issues when creating a commit.

# Build and Test

The build process is running automatically when a pull request is created into the main branch. If the build fails, the pull request won't be able to be completed.
