# Getting Started

[!include[signup-tenant](../includes/signup-tenant.md)]

## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](../permission-setups.md).

## Setup

### To start the Setup

You can choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Release Restrictions - Sales**, and then choose the related link.

[!include[eula](../../includes/eula-page.md)]

Before any the release of a sales document can be stopped based on different criteria, those criteria must be setup in the **Release Restrictions - Sales** setup. Once those setups are completed, the system will automatically start validating the release of a sales document and prevent any sales documents from being released, if they meet the criteria defined.

Please see the [Page Release Restrictions - Sales](page-release-restrictions-sales.md) for details.
