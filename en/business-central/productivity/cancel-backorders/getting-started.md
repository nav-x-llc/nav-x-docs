## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](../permission-setups.md).

## Setup

You can choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
