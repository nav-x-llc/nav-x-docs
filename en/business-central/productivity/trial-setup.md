# Productivity by NAV-X Trial Setup

If you want to try out the Productivity by NAV-X Application with our free trial, you can sign up for the free trial directly through Microsoft AppSource and install the app. The free trial will allow you to test our app for 30 days. You can use the full functionality for 30 days free in any environment (production and sandboxes) in your Business Central SaaS Tenant. If you have not yet signed up for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central tenant, you can sign up for a free trial at the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trial](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/businesscentral) page. Once you have your solution provisioned, you can add the NAV-X National Accounts app directly from the AppSource marketplace. If you have questions about the installation process of an app through Microsoft AppSource, you can review the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions).
