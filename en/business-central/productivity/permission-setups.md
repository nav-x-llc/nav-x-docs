# Permission Setups

You can manage users and permissions within Business Central. You need to assign permission sets to users based on their role as described below. You can learn more about [assigning permission sets to users or user groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions#to-assign-permission-sets-to-users-or-user-groups) in the Microsoft Business Central documentation.

## Permissions for all users

All users require the role with the ID *NAVX LIBRARY* and description *NAV-X Library* assigned.

Since the **Productivity by NAV-X** application provides additional functionality throughout the Business Central application, it is also suggested that the permission set for the application is added to all users. The permission set to choose is dependent on the plan you purchased and the functionality the user needs. The following permission sets are available:

- *NAVX Productivity Starter Permissions*
- *NAVX Productivity Premium Permissions*
- *NAVX Productivity Platinum Permissions*

If you are using the **Productivity by NAV-X** application on Microsoft's SaaS platform, you will not be able to use the functionality without having a license assigned to your user through the Microsoft Admin Center. Your system administrator will be able to assist you with this.
