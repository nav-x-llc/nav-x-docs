## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](../permission-setups.md).

## Setup

### To start the Setup

You can choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Item**, and then choose the related link.

[!include[eula](../../includes/eula-page.md)]

The **Item Card** contains the fast tab *Warehouse*. A new field **Warehouse Unit of Measure** has been added. If defined, this defines the warehouse unit of measure used to calculate the quantity to move for *Bin Replenishments*. If a unit of measure is defined, the quantity to move in a *Bin Replenishment* will always be a multiple of the **Warehouse Unit of Measure**.
