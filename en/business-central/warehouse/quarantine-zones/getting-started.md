## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](../permission-setups.md).

## Setup

### To start the Setup

You can choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link. For each location, you can then select *Home* > *Zones* from the **Locations List** or *Zones* from the **Location Card**.

[!include[eula](../../includes/eula-page.md)]

The **Zones** page contains a new field called **Quarantine Zone**. If this field is enabled, this zone will not be used for bin replenishment calculations
