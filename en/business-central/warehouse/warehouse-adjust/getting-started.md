## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](../permission-setups.md).

## Setup

### To start the Setup

You can choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Locations**, and then choose the related link. The configuration of the functionality has to be done for every location where warehouse adjustment details should be maintained.

[!include[eula](../../includes/eula-page.md)]

The **Location Card** contains the fast tab *Warehouse*. You can define the following field.

|                                                                |                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Maintain Details from Warehouse Adjustments in Item Ledger** | In standard Business Central, the process **Calculate Warehouse Adjustments** summarizes adjustments made in the *Warehouse Item Journal*. If enabled, one *Item Ledger Entry* is created for each *Warehouse Entry* posted and the **Reason Code** and **Description** field values from the *Warehouse Entries* are copied to the *Item Ledger Entry*. |
