# Additional Setups

While the NAV-X National Accounts setup performs most of the setups for you, you might want to understand and review the setups to be able to make changes when needed. All setups described below can be reached by choosing the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon and entering the headings below. They can also be accessed from the [National Accounts Setup](national-accounts-setup.md) page.

## Customer Posting Groups

The National Accounts postings are performed through a new General Ledger Account. You will have to define the **Cash Receipt Account (Interim)**. For this, you might have to create a new G/L account. The Customer Posting Groups can be updated from the *National Accounts Setup Wizard* or by choosing the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon and entering **Customer Posting Groups**. The same page can also be accessed from the **National Accounts Setup** under *Additional*. The National Accounts Setup can be found under *Setup & Extensions > Manual Setup*.
