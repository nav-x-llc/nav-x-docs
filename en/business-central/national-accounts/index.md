## What's New

We release new versions of our software from time to time. Those can include fixes of issues that we found and can also include new functionality. If you have NAV-X National Accounts installed already and a new version becomes available, we will inform you directly within Business Central about this. When you log in to Business Central, the system will display a notification that will inform you about the new version and you can also read about the new features there.

If you want to see an overview of the new features by version, you can read more details about it in our [Release Notes](release-notes.md).

## If have questions, but can't find the answer

Sometimes, you have questions that our documentation doesn't answer. Just contact us through our [Support](htpps://nav-x.com/support/) page. We have a team of experts here to assist you with your questions.

## I am missing functionality

We are trying to provide a broad variety of credit card processing options to meet everyone's needs. However, we cannot always provide every possible scenario. If you are missing functionality, please just contact us through our [Support](https://nav-x.com/support/) page and  submit a feature request. We cannot guarantee that we will be adding every request to our product, but we will review each request and determine, if we can enhance our product with a new feature.
