# Release Notes for NAV-X National Accounts

We release new versions of our software from time to time. Those can include fixes of issues that we found and can also include new functionality. If you have NAV-X National Accounts installed already and a new version becomes available, we will inform you directly within Business Central about this. When you log in to Business Central, the system will display a notification that will inform you about the new version and you can also read about the new features there.

The versions are listed below from the newest version to the earliest version.
