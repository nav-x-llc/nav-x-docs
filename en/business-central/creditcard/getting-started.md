## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the credit card setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](permission-setups.md).

## Assisted Setup

### To start the Setup

When you are on the role center and have not completed the setup for the NAV-X Credit Card app, you will see a notification asking "Do you want to get started with NAV-X Credit Card?". Select **Click here to run the setup** to start the Assisted Setup wizard. Alternatively, you can also choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.

The next step allows you to configure the behavior of the credit card functionality. It is already pre-configured with default values, but if those values do not fit your process, please change them. The following table describes each of the fields available.

|                                               |                                                                                                           |

| **Require Security Code**                     | The card security code (also known as the CVV code) is the 3 or 4-digit code on the card. PCI compliance does not allow you saving the security code electronically or on paper. It is recommended to always enter the security code for each transaction and ask the customer for the code. Sometimes, this is not practical, therefore, this setting allows you to change when a security code has to be entered.<br><br>- **Always**: every time a credit card is charged or authorized, the security code must be entered<br>- **First Authorization per Document**: the first time an authorization for one document is requested, the security code is required.<br>- **First Authorization per Card**: the first time an authorization is requested on this card or the initial validation is done for a new card, the security code is required.<br>- **Never**: the security code is never required. This is the least secure option and should not be used. |
| **Charge Mode**                               | When processing credit cards, there are two different ways of processing the card. The right one for you to choose depends on your processes and individual requirements.<br><br>- **Authorize and Charge**: You are authorizing a transaction on a credit card, which means that you are placing a hold on the customer’s credit card for the order amount. Once you ship and invoice the order, the card will be charged. This guarantees that the customer has enough funds available on their credit card while not charging the card before actually shipping the product. This is the preferred method.<br>- **Sale**: If you have a long period between placing the order and shipping it or if you ship and invoice right after the order is placed, you can also select this option. This will not authorize a card at the time of order entry and will only charge the card when the order is invoiced. This could result in declined cards or insufficient funds at the time of shipping and invoicing. |
| **Do not allow Address Verification Failure** | When credit card transaction are processed, the billing address is validated. If the validation comes back with an error (such as that the address doesn’t match or the validation could not be performed), the user gets a confirmation displayed with the error and then can choose to accept the transaction or not. If you do not want to allow a user to make that decision, check this field and any address verification other than *ok* will result in a failure of the transaction. |
| **Perform initial validation for new cards**  | Check this field, if you want to perform a validation of the credit card, when you enter a new credit card. This will authorize a small transaction on the customer’s card and, if the security code is required, you will have to enter the code. If the address verification as well as the card verification in general, you will be alerted and you could choose not to use the card then. The authorization is voided right after the validation.<br>When placing a small authorization on the card, the customer can see a pending charge on their account. This can stay on the customer’s account for up to several days. |
| **Update Authorization when amount changes**  | When this is checked and the amount changes on a document after a credit card was authorized, the existing authorization is voided and a new authorization for the full amount is placed. This allows to have only one charge per document per credit card, but it can keep the original authorized amount on the card as a “pending charge” for several days and therefore reduce the available amount for a customer’s credit card.<br>Please do not authorize credit cards before the order amount is finalized or typically does not change anymore. |
| **Allow Partial Authorization**               | By default, NAV-X Credit Card requires an authorization for the entire amount of the order or invoice, before the document can be processed. If you want to allow customers to only pay a partial amount before the document can be released, you can select this option. |
| **I am using Service Management**             | If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Premium, which includes Service Management, please check this field. Otherwise, you can leave the field unchecked. If you indicate that you do not use service management, setups related to service management will not be shown in this wizard. |
