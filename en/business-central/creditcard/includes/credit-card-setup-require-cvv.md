| **Require Security Code**                     | The security code (also known as CVV code) is the three or four digit code on the back of the card. You can select between the following options.<br><br>- **Always**: The security code is required for every transaction that is performed. If you have the mode set to “Authorize and Charge”, the security code is required during the authorization, not during the charge. This is the most secure configuration, but it will require you to have the security code for each card given to you by your customer every time you process a transaction. To maintain PCI Compliance, you are not allowed to store the security code for a card either in a software system or on any other handwritten notes.<br>- **First Authorization per Document**: The first time you are processing a transaction for a specific document (e.g. order), you are required to enter the security code. If you change the authorized amount (e.g. increase the order amount) or process partial invoices and then re-authorize the remaining balance, you are not required to enter the security code.<br>- **First Transaction per Card**: This setup will only require you to enter the security code once per card to validate that the card is valid. If you have activated the setting “Perform initial validation for new cards”, the system asks for the security code at the time of entering the credit card and then not anymore.<br>- **Never**: The security code is never required to be entered. This is typically done when the same customer has a lot of recurring orders and charge the credit card. It is the least secure option and should be avoided, if possible. |
