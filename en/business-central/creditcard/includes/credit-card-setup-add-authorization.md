| **Amount**    | Define the amount that should be added. If the **Type** is set to **Percentage**, please define the percentage that should be used to calculate the additional charge. The total amount on the document will be used to calculate the amount based on the percentage. |

This will make it easier updating the document.<br>- **Resource**: You can define a Resource that will be added as a new line to the transaction to record the additional amount that is added. Ideally, you choose the same Resource as you will use later for the actual charges. This will make it easier to update your document. |
