Before you can connect one or many terminals, you have to configure source keys for a particular merchant. The API keys and Pins can be requested from the gateway or can also be created directly within the gateway portal. If you require more information how to create or request more source keys, please contact the gateway support.

A source key is defining the source of transactions. It can be used to identify where a transaction was captured, for instance, you can have multiple source keys based on different locations. To enter a new source key, please choose ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Merchant Account**, and then choose the related link.

Please select the merchant account that you want to enter source keys for and then select the action **Source Keys** to display the list of source keys.  You have to create at least one source key to connect terminals.
