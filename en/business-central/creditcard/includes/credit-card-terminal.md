To open the **Terminals** page, please choose ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Credit Card Terminal**, and then choose the related link.

You can either create a new terminal by selecting the **New** action, which will open the Credit Card Terminal page and you can enter the information and register the terminal there.

## New Terminal Wizard

It is recommended to use the action **New Terminal** to register a new terminal, since this will open a wizard that walks you through the required information step by step. When you select **New Terminal**, the **New Terminal Wizard** opens.

By clicking **Next** you will go to the next page of the wizard. On this page, you can assign a name to the new terminal. Based on the terminal type, the name of the terminal will show at the top of the screen. You can also define the default type of transaction that should be executed by this terminal. If you use the terminal for credit card purchases and have customers pick up their goods or services at that time, you should set the **Default Transaction** to **Sale**. If you want to just hold a certain amount on the credit card until you then later charge the card, you should choose **Authorization**.

You then have to define the merchant and the source key that the terminal will be registered for. Once this information is defined, please click on **Next** to advance to the next page. The next page contains settings to define the capabilities of the terminal.

When advancing to the next page, you will start the actual registration of the terminal. The page describes the steps to perform, you will have to also review your terminal’s manual to determine the proper steps to pair the terminal. Please make sure that the terminal is connected to the internet and shows **Enter Pairing Code** or a similar statement on the screen.

The system will send a request to the gateway and retrieves the pairing code. This code will be displayed on the next page. Please note that there is an expiration date on the pairing code, so please make sure that you enter the code before it expires. Please follow the instructions in the terminal’s manual. Once the pairing process shows as completed on your terminal, please close the page.

The system will check the status of the terminal and a confirmation message will be shown and the wizard advances automatically to the last page. You can now close the wizard by clicking on **Finish**.
