| **Update Authorization when amount changes**  | When you increase the amount of a document, the difference in the original amount and the new amount is authorized against the credit card. This will result in multiple authorizations against the same credit card (which are visible on the customerâ€™s credit card statement) and when the credit card is charged, it will result in multiple charges. This can cause questions from your customers.<br><br>When you place a check mark in this field and the transaction amount increases, the system will void the original authorization and create one new authorization with the full amount leading to only one charge at the time of invoicing the order. However, some banks leave the voided authorization as a pending charge for a few days and that could cause the customer not having their full amount available on their credit cards and can also cause issues with your customers.<br><br>It is recommended to have this field checked unless you have constant order changes and customers inquiring about the authorizations that are held in place. |
| **Allow Partial Authorization**               | By default, NAV-X Credit Card requires an authorization for the entire amount of the order or invoice, before the document can be processed. If you want to allow customers to only pay a partial amount before the document can be released, you can select this option. |
| **Use Amount to Ship**                        | When you want to use the **Amount to Ship** on an order, instead of the **Amount to Invoice** to authorize and charge credit cards for orders, please check this field. |
