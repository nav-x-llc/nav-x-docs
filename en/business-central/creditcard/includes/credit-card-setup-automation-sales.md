| **Auto-Authorize on Release**             | If this field is checked, the credit card authorization is automatically processed when the order or invoice is released, which typically indicates that the document entry is completed. If you are directly posting a document after entry, the posting will automatically release it right before posting as well. If you do not check this field, you must process the credit card authorization manually. |
| **Auto-Reauthorize on Partial Invoice**   | When an authorization is performed for an order and the order is shipped partially, the credit card is charged for the partial amount. If a charge is processed against an authorization, the remaining amount on the authorization is automatically cancelled. If this setup is checked, a new authorization is automatically created at the time of partially invoicing the order. |
| **Only First Authorization**              | If you have **Auto-Reauthorize on Partial Invoice** checked, the system will automatically reauthorize an order whenever a partial invoice was processed. If you check **Only First Authorization**, the system will only authorize the remaining order after the first invoice posting. |
| **Auto-Authorize on Shipment**            | Instead of processing an authorization automatically at the time of releasing the order, you can also define that the credit card is automatically authorized at the time of shipping an order. This can be useful, if your orders typically change a lot until the order is shipped. This will still ensure that the credit card has sufficient funds for the transaction. |
| **Auto-Capture on Release Sales Invoice** | When processing sales invoices and not using sales orders, the amount will be due at the time of posting the invoice. Typically, an invoice is entered and then posted right away. Therefore, instead of authorizing the charge on the credit card at the time of releasing the invoice and then charging the card at the time of posting the invoice (default process), you can also charge the card directly at the time of release.  |
| **Auto-Capture on Release Sales Order**   | This option is only available when the **Charge Mode** is set to **Sale**. In this case, you can decide, if you want the customerâ€™s credit card automatically be charged with the full order amount when the order is released. |
