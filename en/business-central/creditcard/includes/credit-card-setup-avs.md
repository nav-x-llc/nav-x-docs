| **Do not use Address Verification**           | When credit card transactions are processed, the system checks the validity of the billing address defined. If you do not want this, you can turn off the entire Address Verification functionality. |
| **AVS Response for Success**                  | If you are using Address Verification, the system responds with different statuses. You can define here which of the statuses you consider that the verification succeeded. For instance, not always is the full address provided, so you can choose to accept when the zip code matches. |
| **Do not allow Address Verification Failure** | When credit card transaction are processed, the billing address is validated. If the validation comes back with an error (such as that the address doesn’t match or the validation could not be performed), the user gets a confirmation displayed with the error and then can choose to accept the transaction or not. If you do not want to allow a user to make that decision, check this field and any address verification other than *ok* will result in a failure of the transaction. |
| **Perform initial validation for new cards**  | Check this field, if you want to perform a validation of the credit card, when you enter a new credit card. This will authorize a small transaction on the customer’s card and, if the security code is required, you will have to enter the code. If the address verification as well as the card verification in general, you will be alerted and you could choose not to use the card then. The authorization is voided right after the validation.<br>When placing a small authorization on the card, the customer can see a pending charge on their account. This can stay on the customer’s account for up to several days. |
