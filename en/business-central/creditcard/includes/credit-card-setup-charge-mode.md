| **Charge Mode**                               | When processing credit cards, there are two different ways of processing the card. The right one for you to choose depends on your processes and individual requirements.<br><br>- **Authorize and Charge**: You are authorizing a transaction on a credit card, which means that you are placing a hold on the customerâ€™s credit card for the order amount. Once you ship and invoice the order, the card will be charged. This guarantees that the customer has enough funds available on their credit card while not charging the card before actually shipping the product. This is the preferred method.<br>- **Sale**: If you have a long period between placing the order and shipping it or if you ship and invoice right after the order is placed, you can also select this option. This will not authorize a card at the time of order entry and will only charge the card when the order is invoiced. This could result in declined cards or insufficient funds at the time of shipping and invoicing. |
