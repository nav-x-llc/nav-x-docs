# Report Process Sales Document Credit Card Transactions

This process acts as a batch processing function to process credit cards and ACH transactions on a larger amount of documents at a time. If you have multiple sales documents that you want to authorize credit cards for or charge against the orders, you can execute this process.

You can start the process by choosing ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Process Sales Document Credit Card Transactions**, and then choose the related link.

| **Transaction**              | You can select **authorize** or **capture**  to process for all sales documents.   |
| **Do not use security code** | If you require security codes to be entered when processing credit cards, you *must* confirm that you do not want to enter those during the process. |

## Sales Orders and Invoices

You can place different filters to limit the number of documents that should be processed.

Once the filters are placed, you can either preview or print the report. For each processed document, the report will show the information, if the transaction succeeded or failed and what the error message was in case the transaction failed.
