If you want to use credit card terminals to provide your customers with the ability to swipe cards, you need to set up the connection between the physical terminals and your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central environment. The following instructions will walk you through the process of configuring those terminals. See a list of [supported terminals](http://dynamics365creditcard.nav-x.com/supported-credit-card-terminals/).
