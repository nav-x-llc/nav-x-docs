# Report Payment Method Import

If you switched to a sandbox environment and want to import already existing payment methods, you can use this process to import the payment methods from the gateway. If you have customers entering credit card information on the customer portal, you also can use this process to import those payment methods. The process is setup to run automatically on the job queue, so this process typically should not be needed to be executed.

You can start the process by choosing ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Payment Method Import**, and then choose the related link.

You can then apply filters and limit the import of payment methods to a certain subset of your customers or you can choose to import payment methods for all customers. Once you have setup all filters required, you can select **OK** to start the process.

> [!WARNING]
> Depending on the number of your customers and the amount of payment methods defined in the gateway, this process can take a while. It is recommended not to run it during business hours.
