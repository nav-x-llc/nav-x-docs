# How to Process Payment on Account for a customer

If you want to process a deposit from a customer or a pre-payment without an actual sales document, you can perform a **Payment on Account** for a customer. The function is accessible from the **Customer Card** via *Actions > Functions > Process Payment on Account*.

When you select the action **Payment on Account**, the **Charge Payment Methods** page is displayed allowing you to enter one or multiple bank accounts or credit cards. Learn more about the [Charge Payment Methods page](page-authorize-credit-card.md). Once you have entered the amount to be paid on the page and selected the bank accounts or credit cards, the entered amount is charged against the payment methods selected and a payment is posted. The payment will stay open and unapplied until you apply it manually to an invoice to be posted or an already posted invoice.
