# Page Credit Card Pairing Code

During the setup of a new terminal, you will be asked to pair the terminal with the gateway. The page either opens automatically during the **New Terminal Wizard** or when selecting **Register Terminal**.

The page will show a pairing code as well as the expiration time for the code. Please turn on the terminal and follow the instructions on the terminal before the expiration date. Once the terminal is paired, the page will close automatically, if it was displayed during the **New Terminal Wizard**. If you started the page through the action *Register Terminal*, you will have to close the page.
