# Release Notes for November 2020 Update - Version 2.2.11

## Issues

### Prepayment processing

When the credit card setup is configured to not allow partial authorizations and a prepayment invoice is posted from a sales order and the payment method is not credit card or ACH, an error is shown that not enough was authorized. This has been corrected.
