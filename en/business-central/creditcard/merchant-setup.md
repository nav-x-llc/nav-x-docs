# Merchant Setup

Before you can start processing your customers' ACH and credit card payments, you require a merchant account with our gateway. If you have a live merchant account already, you can skip ahead and either use the [Assisted Setup](getting-started.md) to configure NAV-X Credit Card with the live credentials or follow the steps below to update the Credit Card Setup with this information.

## Live Merchant Application

You can fill out our [contact form](http://dynamics365creditcard.nav-x.com/buy-now/) to initiate the merchant application process. We will contact you and work with you to gather the remaining information needed, explain the fees for you, and answer any questions you have. We will be there for you for every step in the way. If you are processing already ACH or credit card transactions with another gateway or even with another software, we can also help you understand the potential savings.

## Merchant Card

You can start the merchant setup by choosing the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Merchant Account**, and then choose the related link. Alternatively, you can also select the action **Merchant Accounts** in the [Credit Card Setup](credit-card-setup.md) page. When you are on the **Merchant Account List**, please click **Edit** to update an existing merchant or select **New** to enter a new merchant account.
