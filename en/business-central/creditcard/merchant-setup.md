# Credit Card Merchant Setup

Before you can start processing your customersâ€™ credit card payments, you require a merchant account with our gateway. If you have a live merchant account already, you can skip ahead and either use the [Assisted Setup](getting-started.md) to configure NAV-X Credit Card with the live credentials or follow the steps below to update the Credit Card Setup with this information.

## Live Merchant Application

You can fill out our [contact form](http://dynamics365creditcard.nav-x.com/buy-now/) to initiate the merchant application process. We will contact you and work with you to gather the remaining information needed, explain the fees for you, and answer any questions you have. We will be there for you for every step in the way. If you are processing already credit card transactions with another gateway or even with another software, we can also help you understand the potential savings.

## Merchant Card

### General

|                                          |                                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Id**                                   | The **Id** is automatically generated and uniquely identifies the merchant account throughout the system       |
| **Description**                          | Define a description that identifies the merchant. For instance, the merchant that is created automatically when you enter credentials in the **Credit Card Setup** or the **Assisted Setup**, has the description *Default Merchant*. |
| **Authorization Expiration Calculation** | Different banks have different timeframes an authorization is valid for. After this time period, those authorizations expire, releasing the funds. Define the authorization period as a date formula in this field to allow the system to automatically reauthorize the authorizations before they expire.<br><br>Please contact your gateway for the best value to define here. |
| **Merchant Account in Currency Code**    | If the merchant account is using any other currency than the local currency as the base for transactions, please define the currency code here. |
| **Country Code**                         | If this merchant is only valid for a specific country, please define the country code in this field. When selecting the proper merchant to use for a specific transaction or customer, the system will first select the merchant that matches the country code defined before looking for other merchants that could be valid. |
| **Use for Dimension**                    | If you have defined a dimension in the **Merchant Dimension Code** field on the **Credit Card Setup**, you can define a dimension value in this field. This will allow the setup of multiple merchants used for different departments, business lines, or other dimensions.
| **Use for Currency Codes**               | You can define multiple merchant accounts and each merchant account can be defined to be used for transactions in a different currency. This can be useful, if you have different merchant accounts to reduce the amounts of foreign exchange transaction charges. |
| **Blocked**                              | You can block a merchant account. When a merchant account is blocked, it cannot be used in the system.         |

| **Email Sender Name**                 | Enter the name that you want to show as the sender in an email that is sent to a customer inviting them to sign up for the customer portal. |

## Actions

### Report > Source Keys

Before you can connect one or many terminals, you have to configure source keys for a particular merchant. The API keys and Pins can be requested from the gateway or can also be created directly within the gateway portal. If you require more information how to create or request more source keys, please contact the gateway support. Learn more about [Source Keys](page-source-keys.md).
