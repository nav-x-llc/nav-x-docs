You can define different payment receipts to be used for different scenarios within the Gateway. To make those receipts available in Business Central, please choose ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Payment Receipts**, and then choose the related link. To import the defined receipt templates from the Gateway, please select the action **Get Receipts**.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to technical limitations in Business Central and in the Gateway, it is currently not possible to use the printed receipt templates for receipts within Business Central. As soon as the abilities are added, we will update the functionality to make it possible to print receipts defined in the gateway.
