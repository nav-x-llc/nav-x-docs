# Release Notes for December 2024 Update - Version 2.2.34

## New Features

### Compatibility with VersaPay - Releasing a Sales Document

There were compatibility issues with an an app by VersaPay as write transactions were started before the order was released. This interfered with Credit Management as errors were displayed. The functionality has been redesigned to be compatible with apps that start write transactions before the release of an order.

## Resolved Issues

### Copy Document

When *Copy Document* is used, the fields for Credit Management on the new document are not cleared. This has been corrected.
