# How To Configure Customers

When you first start using NAV-X Credit Management or when you setup new customers, there are two setups that need to be done for each customer. Those setups can only be done, if you are setup as a **Credit Manager**. You have to decide on a **Credit Limit** for the customer. It is initially setup as zero. Based on the setups, the initial credit limit can mean that a customer has **No Limit** or that the credit limit is infinite.

You can also decide to **Bypass Credit Check** for this customer. This is typically done for customers that have a good standing credit history and that order often and pay on time. If you select this for a customer, no credit limit and past due invoice check will be performed and all orders for this customer can be released and processed.
