# How To Approve Sales Orders

When sales documents are placed on hold, approval requests are sent out through Business Central's workflow system. If you are a workflow approver, you will receive those approval requests either on the *Role Center* in the **Requests to approve** or by choosing the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon and entering **Requests to approve** and then selecting the appropriate link.

You can review the different approval requests and select **Open Record** to review the actual document. If you defined that the document can be approved, you can select **Approve** to release the sales document. If you have defined in the setup that you require comments at time of approval, a comment page will be displayed and you can enter any details on why you chose to approve the sales documents.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also approve requests by using your phone or tablet, if you have the **Dynamics 365 Business Central Universal App**
