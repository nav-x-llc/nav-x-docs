# Page OpSuite General Ledger Map

If you purchased the *Standard* plan, the only integration available is to integrate the financial summary from OpSuite™ to Business Central. The data being imported from OpSuite™ must be mapped to G/L Accounts in Business Central. This page allows the mapping to be configured.

The page can be access directly when you choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **OpSuite General Ledger Map**, and then choose the related link.
