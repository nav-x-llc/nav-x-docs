## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the OpSuite™ Integration Setup is started to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](permission-setups.md).

## Assisted Setup

### To start the Setup

When you are on the role center and have not completed the setup for the NAV-X OpSuite™ Integration app, you will see a notification asking "Do you want to get started with the NAV-X OpSuite Integration?". If you have started the setup, but not completed it, you will see a notification asking "Your NAV-X OpSuite Integration setup is not completed. Do you want to complete it now?"  Select **Click here to run the setup** to start the Assisted Setup wizard. Alternatively, you can also choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Assisted Setup**, and then choose the related link.
