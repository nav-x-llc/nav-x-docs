# Custom Fields Setup

When you are on the role center and have not completed the setup for the NAV-X Custom Fields app, you will see a notification asking "Do you want to get started with NAV-X Custom Fields?". Select **Click here to run the setup** to start the Setup. Alternatively, you can also choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Custom Fields Setup**, and then choose the related link.

Currently, the only option on the *Custom Fields Setup* is the ability to **Enable Custom Field Management**. If this is checked, the functionality can be used.
