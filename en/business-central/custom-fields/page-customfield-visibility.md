# Page Custom Visibility

After you defined specific custom fields, you can define where those fields should be displayed. By default, some pages have certain fields displayed automatically, but this can be customized through the **Custom Fields Visibility** page that can be accessed as an action from the **Custom Fields Definitions** page.

When you open the **Custom Fields Visibility** page from the **Custom Fields Definitions** page, it will be filtered on the custom field that is currently selected and will allow you to configure the behavior for this field for the listed pages. If a standard page is not available, but you would like to have the fields displayed there, please contact us and we can add this as a possible feature request and possible enhancement in one of our future versions.

The following fields are available on the page.

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| Page No. | The internal ID of the page |
| Page Name | The internal page that name you can define the visibility for this field for |
| Page Caption | The caption of the page in the current language |
| Visible | Defines whether this field is shown or not |
