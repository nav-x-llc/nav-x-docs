# Page Custom Fields Report Fields

We have enabled some of the custom fields to be used in different reports. If you select the **Report Visibility** action on the **Custom Fields Definitions** page, you will see a list of the reports that this specific field is enabled for. If the list is empty or the report that you use typically is not there, please let us know and we can see, if we can enable this report in one of our future releases as well.

The report fields functionality allows you to change the report layout to be used to a new layout and then you can activate the field easily from within here.

The page contains the following fields. The majority of those fields are not editable and you cannot add additional reports to the page.

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| **Report Name** | Name of the report we enabled for this functionality |
| **Table** | The table the custom field comes from that is enabled for this functionality |
| **Type** | The type of the custom field that is enabled for this functionality |
| **Field No.** | The field number that is enabled for this functionality |
| **Visible** | A checkmark that allows you to turn on or off this field on the report. You must use our layout or a copy of our layout for this functionality to work |

## Report Layouts

If you review the report layouts on the **Report Layouts** page, which can be accessed directly when you choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Report Layouts**, and then choose the related link, you can see for some reports an additional layout that is published by the **Extension** *Custom Fields by NAV-X*. The **Layout Name** typically is the name of the report with a *- Custom Fields* at the end of it. If you mark this layout as the default layout or setup custom layouts, the functionality described above can be used.
