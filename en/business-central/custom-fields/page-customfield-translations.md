# Page Custom Fields Translations

If you have users speaking different languages and having their profiles within Business Central configured to display the User Interface in that language, you can setup translations for each field. The current language is always automatically added as a translation. Based on the language defined in your settings in Business Central, the proper translation will be used. If the language isn't defined in the translation, the default language will be used.

The configuration of the allowed values can be done via the **Custom Fields Translations** page that can be accessed as an action from the **Custom Fields Definitions** page.

When you open the **Custom Fields Translations** page, it will show the already defined translations for the current field in the *Custom Fields Definitions* page. You can add more translations or change existing ones.

The following fields are available on the page.

| Field | Description |
|-|-|
| **Language Code** | The language the translation is for. You can select one of the existing languages |
| **Field Caption** | The translation for the field in the language shown in the *Language Code* |
