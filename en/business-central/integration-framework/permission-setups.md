# Permission Setups

You can manage users and permissions within Business Central. You need to assign permission sets to users based on their role as described below. You can learn more about [assigning permission sets to users or user groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions#to-assign-permission-sets-to-users-or-user-groups) in the Microsoft Business Central documentation.

## Permissions for all users

All users require the role with the ID *NAVX LIBRARY* and description *NAV-X Library* assigned.

## Permissions for Integration Framework users

Any user who is going to access either the Integration Framework Setup or the Integration Framework processing, requires special permissions assigned. The permission set *NAVX IF STANDARD* and description *NAV-X Integration Framework Standard Permissions* will have to be assigned to those users.
