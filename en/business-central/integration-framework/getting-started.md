# Getting Started

## Permission Setup

Permissions for the app must be setup before the NAV-X Integration Framework can be used to ensure that the users can access the setup and also use the functionality properly once the setup is completed. You can find more information under [Permission Setups](permission-setups.md).

## To start the Setup

Choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **NAV-X Integration Setups**, and then choose the related link.

[!include[eula](../includes/eula.md)]

This setup will allow you to configure general integration behaviors. Read more details about the [NAV-X Integration Setup page](page-integration-setup.md).

## To set up Integrations

To setup the different integrations that will be used, please open the page **NAV-X Integrations**. Choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **NAV-X Integrations**, and then choose the related link.

Here you can setup the integrations you want to use and where you want to use them. The following fields can be configured:

[!include[table-definition](includes/table-definition.md)]

Read more details about the [NAV-X Integrations page](page-integrations.md).

## Integration Fields

To be able to use an integration, you must define fields that are being integrated. Please select the [Fields page](page-integration-fields.md) from the action bar of the *NAV-X Integrations* page.

Read more details about the [Integration Fields page](page-integration-fields.md).

## Integration Field Mappings

Once the integration is configured and the fields are defined, the integration fields must be mapped to tables and fields within Business Central. This can be done through the [Mappings page](page-integration-mappings.md).

Read more details about the [Integration Mappings page](page-integration-mappings.md).

The integration is now configured and can be used.
