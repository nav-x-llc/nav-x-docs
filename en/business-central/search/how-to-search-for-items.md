# How to Search for Items

You can use the advanced search to search easily for items. You can either use the <!-- [Search Worksheet](../page-search-worksheet.md) --> to search for vendors or you can select *Process -> Advanced Search* from the Item List.

When you select the **Advanced Search** from the **Item List**, the page [Search Dialog](page-search-dialog.md) is opened. You can search for item information as well as for item attributes. If you want to search for item attributes, please select *Process -> Advanced Attribute Search*. <!-- Learn more about [entering search criteria](../how-to-enter-search-criteria.md). --> You can enter any value and then press **Enter** or **Tab** or you can click on the **OK** button of the page. The system then will search in the different fields that are defined to be included in the search for the items.

The search results are then shown on the **Item List**, which is filtered to only include the search results. If you want to refine the search criteria, you can select *Process -> Advanced Search* again and enter additional search criteria. The search results will then display all previously filters as well. If you want to reset the filters and show all items again, you can select the action **Reset Filters** (*Process -> Reset Filters*).
