# Page Search Fields

You can customize your search experience by adjusting which tables are included in search results. As part of this customization, you can also define the fields that should be reviewed when searching for different terms. This is done in the **Search Fields** page that can be access from the **Search Tables** and **Search Document Tables** page by clicking on the **No. of included fields**.
