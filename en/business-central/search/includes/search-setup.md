Currently, there are no setup fields available for NAV-X Search. In the future, we will add additional setup functionality to this page. As of now, the Search Setup is an easy way to access all additional setup pages required for the functionality to work.

## Actions

### Process > Search Tables

If you run through the [Assisted Setup](../getting-started.md) and have already selected the tables that you want to include in your search experience, this is already completed. However, you can always customize your search experience by adding or removing tables from the setup or adding or removing fields from individual tables. Learn more about [configuring search tables](../page-search-tables.md).

### Process > Document Search Tables

If you run through the [Assisted Setup](../getting-started.md) and have already selected the document tables you want to include in your search experience, this is already completed. However, you can always customize your search experience by adding or removing documents or adding or removing fields from individual tables. Learn more about [configuring search document tables](../page-search-document-tables.md).
