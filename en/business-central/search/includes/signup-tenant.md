If you do not have a tenant for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/businesscentral).

Once you have completed the sign up and your tenant is up and running, you can add the NAV-X Search app from the [AppSource Marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365-business-central/PUBID.navx|AID.2c382490-2740-4817-b9a0-1d7f1b050057|PAPPID.815109ff-72ac-410a-9b58-0cc40448dda1?tab=Overview).
