# Permission Setups

You can manage users and permissions within Business Central. You need to assign permission sets to users based on their role as described below. You can learn more about [assigning permission sets to users or user groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions#to-assign-permission-sets-to-users-or-user-groups) in the Microsoft Business Central documentation.

## Permissions for all users

All users require the role with the ID *NAVX LIBRARY* and description *NAV-X Library* assigned.

Since the **NAV-X Base Application** provides additional functionality throughout the Business Central application, it is also suggested that the permission set *NAVX BASE USER* and the description *NAV-X Base Application User* is added to all users.

## Permissions for administrators

Any user involved in setting up any of the NAV-X Base Application functionality requires an additional permission set configured. The permission set *NAVX BASE Super* and description *NAV-X Base Application Super* has to be assigned to those users.
