# How to Setup Customers for Back Orders

## Customer Setup

The **Shipping** fast tab has a new field called **Auto Cancel Backorders**. If this field is enabled, Sales Orders are marked as *Auto Cancel Backorder* when this customer is used as the *Sell-to Customer* on the order unless the *Ship-to Address* used on the order has a different setup. The field on the Sales Order can also be manually updated.

## Ship-to Address Setup

The **General** fast tab has a new field called **Auto Cancel Backorders**. This field can be set to *Blank* ("") to let the *Sell-to Customer* setting of the field **Auto Cancel Backorders** define whether back order should be cancelled. If the field is set to *Yes*, the orders are marked as *Auto Cancel Backorder* when the Ship-to Address is used as the *Ship-to Code* on the order. If the field is set to *No*, the orders are not marked as *Auto Cancel Backorder*. The field on the Sales Order can also be manually updated.
