# Page Posted Sales Commission

The **Sales Commission** page displays commission information for the current sales transaction. It can be accessed from the posted sales document by selecting the action **Commissions** (*Navigate > Document > Commissions*).The **General** fast tab shows information about the customer and ship-to address as well as the total **Commissionable Amount**, and the **Commission Amount**. If you are a commission manager, you can see commissions for all salespeople. If you are not a commission manager, you can only see your own commissions.
