# How To Setup Default Commission Splits

If you have combinations of salespeople that often receive commission together for customers, you can setup default commission splits using a new salesperson code. For instance, you can setup a new salesperson called **AHPS** and define a commission split for this salesperson that defines that salesperson **AH** always receives 80% of the sales commission and salesperson **PS** always receives 20% of the sales commission. You then can assign salesperson **AHPS** on the customer or the sales document and that automatically fills the **Commission Split** with the appropriate setup.

## Setup

To setup commission splits for a salesperson, you first have to create a new salesperson or choose an existing one. Learn how to [set up salespeople](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/sales-how-setup-salespeople). You can access the Salesperson card choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Salespeople/Purchasers**, and then choose the related link.

On the salesperson card, choose action *Salesperson > Commission Splits*. This will open the [Commission Split Page](page-commission-salesperson-split.md). Here you can define the different salespeople as well as the percentages that should be included.
