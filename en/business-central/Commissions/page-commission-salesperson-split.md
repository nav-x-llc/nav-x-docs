# Page Salesperson Split

You can define multiple salespeople responsible for a sale. All salespeople defined in the **Salesperson Split** will receive commissions as defined in the **Commission Rates**. The **Salesperson Split** can be defined as a default on each customer. You can also change it on an individual sales document.

You can define different split percentages for each salesperson. The split is used to only give partial commission for a specific sale to an individual salesperson. You can define a **Split** between zero and 100 percent. The **Split** defines the percentage of the total amount, based on **Calculate Commission On**, that will be paid as commission to the salesperson.
