# Resource Setup

When you setup commissions using the Setup Wizard, you might have selected the option already to make all resources commissionable. This will mark all recourses that existed during the setup process as commissionable. Any new resources will have to be setup manually to make them commissionable. If any resource is not setup to be **Commissionable**, the system will not calculate commissions for this resource, even if commission rates are setup for it.
