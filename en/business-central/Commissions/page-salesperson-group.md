# Page Salesperson Group

You can define **Salesperson Groups** and assign those to the different salespeople to simplify the definition of commission rates. Each salesperson that receives the same rate can be grouped in a **Salesperson Group** and then, commission rates can be easily setup on the group level, instead of changing rates on every salesperson individually.

The page can also be access directly when you choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Salesperson Group**, and then choose the related link.

## Actions

### Commissions

You can define the commission rates for a group by accessing the **Commissions** action through *Navigate > Commissions*.

### Days overdue Reduction

You have the ability to define different commission rates for salespeople that are in effect when invoices are paid late. It is possible to define different commission rates based on the amount of days that an invoice is overdue. For instance, you can define that a salesperson receives reduced commission rates when an invoice is overdue for 60 days and even less commission when an invoice is overdue for 90 days. You can access the setup for this salesperson group from the action **Days overdue Reduction** through *Navigate > Days overdue Reduction*.
