# Page Commission Split Mappings

You can define multiple salespeople responsible for a sale. All salespeople defined in the **Commission Split Mappings** will receive commissions as defined in the **Commission Rates**. The **Commission Split Mappings** will define the **Commission Split** on each sales document based on the values on the sales document.

You can define different split percentages for each salesperson. The split is used to only give partial commission for a specific sale to an individual salesperson. You can define a **Split** between zero and 100 percent. The **Split** defines the percentage of the total amount, based on **Calculate Commission On**, that will be paid as commission to the salesperson.
