# Page Commission Rates

The **Commission Rates** page allows the definition of all commission rates in the system. It can be opened from the **Salesperson Card**, **Customer Card**, **Ship-to Address**, **Item Card**, **G/L Account Card**, **Resource Card**, **Item Charges List**, **Item Categories**, and **Resource Groups**.

## Actions

### Copy From

You can copy existing rate setups from other entities, instead of defining the rates manually. This action is available from any Salesperson, Salesperson group, Customer, Item, Item Category, Resource, Resource Group, G/L Account, or Charge (Item). When you select this action, a dialog opens in which you can select the record to copy the rates from. If you select **Yes**, the rates are copied. If you select **No**, the rates will not be copied.
