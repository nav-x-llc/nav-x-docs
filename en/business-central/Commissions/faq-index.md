### I want to change when my commissions are payable

You can make changes to the **[Commission Setup](commission-setup.md)** at any time. However, when you make changes, those changes only apply to any future transactions. When you, for instance, have your commissions set to be payable at *Cash Receipt* and change that to *Invoice*, any new commission transactions will be payable when the invoice is posted. Any existing commission transactions will not become payable. Therefore, it is not suggested to make those changes when you have a lot of open commission ledger entries.
