# Item Setup

When you setup commissions using the Setup Wizard, you might have selected the option already to make all items commissionable. This will mark all items that existed during the setup process as commissionable. Any new items will have to be setup manually to make them commissionable. If any item is not setup to be **Commissionable**, the system will not calculate commissions for this items, even if commission rates are setup for the item.
