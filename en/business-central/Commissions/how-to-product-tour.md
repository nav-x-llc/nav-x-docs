# How to use the product tour

When you first install the Commission Management app, you will notice that you can start a product tour through a notification on the top of the role center. You can also always start the product tour from the **Commission Setup** page. When you choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Commission Setup**, and then choose the related link. You can select **Start Product Tour** (*Help -> Start Product Tour*).

The product tour will first download a configuration package to import default settings when you are in the *Cronus* company. This setup will default everything for you to be able to start testing the functionality - setups and commission rates are imported. You then can select **Yes** in the confirmation dialog to show the **Salesperson Page** and validate what setups have been chosen.

After this, you can start creating sales orders and assign salespeople that have commission rates defined and see the system in action.
