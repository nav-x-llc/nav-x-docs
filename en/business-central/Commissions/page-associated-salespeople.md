# Page Associated Salespeople

You can define commissions for sales managers to receive commissions based on their team's performance. With the page **Associated Salespeople** you can define the sales team that is reporting to any specific sales manager. You can access this page from the **Salespeople/Purchasers** list or **Salespeople/Purchasers Card** using the action **Associated Salespeople** (*Salespeople > Associated Salespeople*).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Associated Salespeople** is only shown as an action, if you have turned on **Commissions for Managers** in the **Features** fast tab in the [Commission Setup](page-commission-setup.md)
