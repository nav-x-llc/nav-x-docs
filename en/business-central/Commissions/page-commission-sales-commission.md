# Page Sales Commission

The **Sales Commission** page displays commission information for the current sales transaction. It can be accessed from the sales document by selecting the action **Commissions** (*Navigate > Document > Commissions*). The **General** fast tab shows information about the customer and ship-to address as well as the total **Commissionable Amount**, and the **Commission Amount**. If you are a commission manager, you can see commissions for all salespeople and also make changes to those commissions. If you are not a commission manager, you can only see your own commissions.

## Manual Commissions

You can make changes to the system calculated commissions by overwriting one of the values, such as the commission rate or the commission amount. Whenever you change a system calculated commission, the field **System Created** will be unchecked to identify that this is a commission that will not be updated when you select the **Calculate Commissions** action on the sales document.

In addition to updating existing commissions, you can also create new commissions. You can enter a new line and define any commission for any salesperson. This is important, if you want to give commission to a certain salesperson as an exception.
