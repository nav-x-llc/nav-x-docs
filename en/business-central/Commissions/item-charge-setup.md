# Item Charge Setup

When you setup commissions using the Setup Wizard, you might have selected the option already to make all item charges commissionable. This will mark all item charges that existed during the setup process as commissionable. Any new item charges will have to be setup manually to make them commissionable. If any item charge  is not setup to be **Commissionable**, the system will not calculate commissions for this item charge, even if commission rates are setup.
