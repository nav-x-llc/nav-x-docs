# Page Customer Commission Group

Commission groups can be used to define the one commission structure and apply it to a number of different customers with different **Customer Price Groups** or **Customer Discount Groups**. The page can also be access directly when you choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **Customer Commission Groups**, and then choose the related link.

The **Customer Commission Groups** can be defined on the customer in the field **Commission Group** on the **General** tab. To create a new commission group, fill out the relevant fields. Hover over the field to see a short description.
