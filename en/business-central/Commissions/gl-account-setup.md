# General Ledger Account Setup

When you setup commissions using the Setup Wizard, you might have selected the option already to make all general ledger accounts commissionable. This will mark all G/L Accounts that existed during the setup process as commissionable. Any new G/L accounts will have to be setup manually to make them commissionable. If any G/L Account is not setup to be **Commissionable**, the system will not calculate commissions for this G/L account, even if commission rates are setup.
