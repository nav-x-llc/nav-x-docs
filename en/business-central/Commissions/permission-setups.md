# Permission Setups

You can manage users and permissions within Business Central. You need to assign permission sets to users based on their role as described below. You can learn more about [assigning permission sets to users or user groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/ui-how-users-permissions#to-assign-permission-sets-to-users-or-user-groups) in the Microsoft Business Central documentation.

## Permissions for all users

All users require the role *NAV-X LIBRARY* assigned. it will automatically done at the time of installation of the app, so all users that exist at this time will have this this role already assigned. However, any new users will require this role to be setup when the user is created.

## Permissions for Commission users

Any user that is involved in setting up the commission functionality or commission rates as well as entering or posting sales documents and processing commissions requires additional permissions configured. The permission set *COMMISSIONS*‚Äù* will have to be assigned to those users. This assignment should be done before the commission setup is started.
