# Page Commission Types

You can use **Commission Types** to differentiate or classify different commissions and also to calculate multiple commissions for a salesperson for a single transaction. For instance, you can use a commission type to calculate a *normal sales commission* and additionally, you can use a different commission type to calculate an *annual bonus* for the salesperson.

| **Code**                                      | Define a unique code to identify the commission type                                                          |
| **Description**                               | Describe the commission type for users to understand when to use it                                           |
| **Tiered Commission Period**                  | Tiered commissions provide additional commissions to salespeople when reaching a goal. It is possible to define different periods for different commission types. With this, you can, for instance, define quarterly as well as annual bonuses. The options you can choose from are:<br><br>- Day<br>- Week<br>- Month<br>- Quarter<br>- Year<br>- Fiscal Year<br>- Accounting Period |
| **Single Payment only per Commission Period** | As soon as a target is reached for a tiered commission, the next commission rate will be paid on every following sale for the period. This is not wanted for, for instance, bonuses as those are one time payments in a specific period. If you want to only pay a rate once in a period, please enable this field |
| **Only pay difference**                       | If you have multiple commission tiers defined and you define the payments as combined payments, you can define that only the difference between the previous tier and the new tier is paid out in a period. You can use this, for instance, if you want to provide a total bonus to your salesperson of $5,000 when reaching a certain sales in a month, but also want to reward the salesperson with $1,000 when reaching a lower level, but not pay more than the total $5,000. |
