# Release Notes for August 2024 Update - Version 2.5.233

## New Features

### Copilot for Commission Management (preview)

We have added the ability to generate commission rates using Microsoft Copilot. On the **Commission Rates** page, a new action is present called **Draft with Copilot...**. This function can only be used, if the *Commission Rates* capability in the **Production ready previews** section on the page **Copilot & AI capabilities** is activated.

## Resolved Issues

### Salesperson change on Document Header

When changing the field **Salesperson Code** on any of the sales documents headers, the commission split is not properly updated and the commission lines are not properly recalculated. This has been corrected.
