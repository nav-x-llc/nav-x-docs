# Release Notes for May 2024 Patch - Version 2.4.200

## Resolved Issues

### Data Administration - Delete Expired Rates

When running the *Data Administration - Delete expired Rates* process, instead of deleting expired rates, the process deleted active rates. This has been corrected.

### Commission Type - only pay once flag

If a **Commission Type** is defined to *only pay once* per period, the system adds the same commission to every single line on a sales document, instead of only adding it once. This has been corrected.

### Edit Cost on Commission Ledger Entry

When the cost is edited on a *Commission Ledger Entry*, the **Date Payable** is changed incorrectly. This has been corrected.
