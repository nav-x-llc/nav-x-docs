# Release Notes for September 2024 Update - Version 2.5.236

## New Features

### Copilot for Commission Management (preview)

We have added the ability to generate commission rates using Microsoft Copilot. On the **Commission Rates** page, a new action is present called **Draft with Copilot...**. This function can only be used, if the *Commission Rates* capability in the **Production ready previews** section on the page **Copilot & AI capabilities** is activated.

### Tiered Commissions based on document

New functionality has been added to allow the calculation of tiered commissions based on the sales amount, gross profit percentage, or the gross profit amount of the entire sales document.

## Resolved Issues

### Salesperson change on Document Header

When changing the field **Salesperson Code** on any of the sales documents headers, the commission split is not properly updated and the commission lines are not properly recalculated. This has been corrected.
