# Release Notes for January 2024 Patch - Version 2.3.147

## Resolved Issues

### Credit Memo: Commissionable Amount

When a salesperson record exists with the same primary key as the resource that is on the line, the **Commisisonable Amount** is incorrect for Credit Memos. Running the *Recalculate Commissions* process fixed this issue as a work around. This has been corrected.

### Credit Memos: Gross Profit %

The **Gross Profit %** was displayed as a negative value for Credit Memos in commission lines and the commission ledger entries. This has been corrected.
