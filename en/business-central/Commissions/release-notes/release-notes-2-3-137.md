# Release Notes for December 2023 Patch - Version 2.3.137

## Resolved Issues

### Commissions for Resources: Commissionable Amount

The **Commissionable Amount** for Resources is always set to the commissionable quantity. This is incorrect, as the **Commissionable Amount** needs to be set based on the setup field **Calculate Commissions On**. This has been corrected.
