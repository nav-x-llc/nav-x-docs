# Release Notes for July 2024 Update - Version 2.5.230

## Resolved Issues

### Recalculate Posted Sales Document Commissions double-up

When recalculating commissions for posted invoices and credit memos, the credit memo commissions are incorrectly adjusted. This has been corrected.

### Permissions

The table "NAVX Commission Company" is missing from a permission set. This has been corrected.

### Detailed permission fields on User Setup

When the field **Commission Manager** is checked, the detailed permission fields are not unchecked automatically. This has been corrected.

### Effective date for resources not populating correctly

The effective date for resource commissions has not been set to the work date defined on the sales document. This has been corrected.

### NAV-X Commission Notification

The notification for NAV-X Commission Management, which can be accessed under **My Notifications**, is starting with *NAV-X*. This has been updated.
