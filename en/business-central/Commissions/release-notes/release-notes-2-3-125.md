# Release Notes for November 2023 Update - Version 2.3.125

## New Features

### Power BI Query for Resource Commissions

A new Query has been added for Resources similarly to the Salesperson Commission Queries that can be used in Power BI.

## Resolved Issues

### Credit Memo: Gross Profit Amount

The **Gross Profit Amount** for Credit Memos in Commission Ledger Entries is currently positive, but should be shown as negative. This has been corrected.

### Recalculting Old Documents

When an accounting period is closed and commissions are recalculated for a document, an error shows that the posting date is not allowed. The posting date will be changed to the current period. This has been corrected.
