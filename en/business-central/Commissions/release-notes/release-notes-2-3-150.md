# Release Notes for January 2024 Patch - Version 2.3.150

## Resolved Issues

### Commission Split By Dimensions

When the dimension value of a dimension is changed and this is not mapped to a Salesperson, the *Commission Split* is properly updated, but the *Commission Lines* are not properly re-calculated. This has been corrected.
