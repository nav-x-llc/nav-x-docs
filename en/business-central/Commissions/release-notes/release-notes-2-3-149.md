# Release Notes for January 2024 Patch - Version 2.3.149

## Resolved Issues

### Salesperson not "Enabled for Commissions"

When the Salesperson defined in the **Salesperson Code** on the Document Header is not **Enabled for Commissions**, the Salesperson is still added to the *Commission Split* and then causes an error, when commissions are calculated. This has been corrected.
