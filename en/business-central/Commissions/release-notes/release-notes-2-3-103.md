# Release Notes for September 2023 Patch - Version 2.3.103

## Resolved Issus

### Readiness for Business Central 2023 Wave 2

Changes have been made to ensure that **NAV-X Commission Management** is compatible with Business Central 2023 Wave 2.

### Wrong Caption on General Journal Lines

In the Gen. Journal, when selecting the Line Action, the Caption for the Commissions functions shows as Commission Rates. Selecting Commission Rates opens the Journal Line Commissions page. This has been corrected.

### Type must not be

When trying to open the *Posted Slaes Invoice Line Commission* page, the error message *Type must not be G/L Account in Sales Invoice Line* is displayed. This has been corrected.
