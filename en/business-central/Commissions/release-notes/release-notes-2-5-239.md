# Release Notes for September 2024 Update - Version 2.5.239

## New Features

### Initial Commissions

We have enhanced the functionality of "Initial Commissions". Initial commissions can be used to define different rates for a specific timeframe, for instance, if a Salesperson sells a specific item for the first time. It is now also possible to define commission rates for item categories and those rates then apply for each item within the item category, if the item is sold for the first time for a specific customer.

### Non Commissionable Sales Lines

It is now possible to define **Non Commissionable Mappings**. This functionality allows to define Global and Shortcut Dimension combinations for specific Items, G/L Accounts, Resources, Item Charges, as well as Resource Groups and Item Categories, which then will mark document lines non-commissionable (or commissionable), regardless of what is defined on the actual master record.

### Commission Rate Filters

It is now possible to define filters on commission rates for sales documents. Those filters will determine that a specific Commission Rate is only valid, if the specific line matches the filter criteria.
