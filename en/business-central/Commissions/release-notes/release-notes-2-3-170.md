# Release Notes for March 2024 Patch - Version 2.3.170

## Resolved Issues

### Posted Commission Line Page is not showing fields

When the *User Setup* is defined for an user to not be a **Commission Manager**, but also don't hide specific fields. The hiding of those fields was inconsistent between the different pages. This has been corrected.
