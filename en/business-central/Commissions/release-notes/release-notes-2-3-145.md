# Release Notes for January 2024 Patch - Version 2.3.146

## Resolved Issues

### Credit Memo: Recalculate

The recalculation of credit memos was not using the posting date defined on the report request page. This has been corrected.
If the posting date is not allowed, an error stops the processing. This has been corrected.
At the end of the process, an error stating the default implementation cannot be used was shown. This has been corrected.
