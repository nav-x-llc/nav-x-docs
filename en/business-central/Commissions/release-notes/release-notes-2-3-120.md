# Release Notes for November 2023 Patch - Version 2.3.120

## Resolved Issues

### Fixed Amount per Quantity calculation

When a rate is defined with a type of *Fixed Amount per Quantity* and a commission split (not equal to 100) is used, the **Commission Amount** is calculated incorrectly. This has been corrected.

### Commission Ledger Entry Status not updated

When posting a cash application with a **Payment Type** that is set to blank, the commission ledger entries are not updated. This has been corrected.
