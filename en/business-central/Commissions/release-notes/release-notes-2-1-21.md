# Release Notes for April 2021 Update - Version 2.1.21

## Resolved Issues

### Salesperson Group Commission Rates

It was not possible to enter the same commission rates for different salesperson groups. For instance, it was not possible to enter a "blank" rate (valid for all salespeople and all items in the group) for two different groups. This has been corrected.
