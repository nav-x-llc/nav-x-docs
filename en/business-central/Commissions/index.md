## If have questions, but can't find the answer

Sometimes, you have questions that our documentation doesn't answer. Just contact us through our [Support](htpps://nav-x.com/support/) page. We have a team of experts here to assist you with your questions.

## I am missing functionality

We are trying to provide a broad variety of commission management options to meet everyone's needs. However, we cannot always provide every possible commission calculation scenario. If you are missing functionality, please just contact us through our [Support](https://nav-x.com/support/) page and  submit a feature request. We cannot guarantee that we will be adding every request to our product, but we will review each request and determine, if we can enhance our product with a new feature.
