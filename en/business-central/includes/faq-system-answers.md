### My License Expiration Explained

You can find your license information on the **About NAV-X** page. To open this page, choose the ![Tell me what you want to do](/images/magnifying-glass.gif) icon, enter **About NAV-X**, and then choose the related link to open the related page. On this page, you will see the different NAV-X apps that you have installed at the bottom under *Our Installed Apps*.

You will see the license type for each NAV-X app that is installed in your system. If your license type shows **Trial**, you are currently using our free trial. We provide everyone downloading and installing our apps on a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central SaaS tenant a 30 day free trial. Once the trial is over, you will see that you are not licensed anymore. You will have to purchase a license for the app you wish to use to be able to use it.

If the license type shows **Full**, you have a valid license and can use the app. As all licenses are subscription licenses, the License **Expiration Date** shows the date one month from the date you purchased the product or renewed the subscription. If you are on a monthly subscription, you get charged monthly for the subscription and the expiration date advances. If you are on an annual subscription, you get charged on an annual basis, but the license expiration date still only shows a monthly expiration and gets automatically renewed.
